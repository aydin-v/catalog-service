1. Explain the difference between terms: REST and RESTful.

REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for building web services. 
It is a set of constraints that are applied to the design of web services to make them more scalable, flexible, and maintainable.

RESTful, on the other hand, is an adjective used to describe web services that adhere to the REST architectural style.
A web service is considered RESTful if it meets all the constraints of REST, such as using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
to perform operations on resources, using URIs to identify resources, and using hypermedia links to navigate between resources.

2. What are the six constraints?

Statelessness: The server should not store any client context between requests. Each request should contain all the necessary 
information for the server to understand and process it.

Cacheability: Responses from the server should be cacheable or non-cacheable depending on the nature of the response.

Layered system: A client should not be able to tell whether it is communicating directly with the server or through an intermediary, 
such as a load balancer or a proxy server.

Uniform interface: The interface between the client and server should be standardized to promote scalability and simplicity.

Code on demand (optional): Servers can optionally provide executable code to clients, such as JavaScript, to be executed within the client's context. 
This constraint is optional and not always used in RESTful web services.

3. Is HTTP the only protocol supported by REST?

No, HTTP is not the only protocol supported by REST, but it is the most commonly used protocol. 
REST is an architectural style that is protocol-agnostic, which means that it can be implemented using any protocol that supports the required constraints.
However, HTTP is the most widely used protocol for implementing RESTful web services because it provides a standardized set of
methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that can be used to interact with resources, and it also supports the use of URIs to identify resources. 
Additionally, HTTP provides built-in support for caching, which is one of the constraints of REST.
Other protocols that can be used to implement RESTful web services include HTTPS, FTP, and SMTP, among others.

4. HTTP Request Methods (the difference) and HTTP Response codes. What is idempotency?

HTTP Request Methods:
GET: Used to retrieve a resource from the server. It should not modify any data on the server.
POST: Used to submit data to the server to create a new resource. It can also be used to update an existing resource.
PUT: Used to update an existing resource on the server. It replaces the entire resource with the new data.
DELETE: Used to delete a resource from the server.
PATCH: Used to update a part of an existing resource on the server.

HTTP Response Codes:
1xx: Informational responses
2xx: Successful responses
3xx: Redirection messages
4xx: Client error responses
5xx: Server error responses

Idempotency is a property of an HTTP method that means that if the same request is made multiple times, the result should be the same as if the request was made only once. 
In other words, making the same request multiple times should not have any additional side effects beyond the first request.

5. What are the advantages of statelessness in RESTful services?

Statelessness is one of the key constraints of RESTful services, and it offers several advantages, including:
Scalability: Stateless services are easier to scale because they do not maintain any client context between requests. This means that requests can be load-balanced across multiple servers without any issues.
Simplicity: Stateless services are simpler to design and implement because they do not require any server-side state management. This makes them easier to maintain and troubleshoot.
Reliability: Stateless services are more reliable because they do not rely on any server-side state. This means that if a server fails, the client can simply retry the request on another server without any issues.
Caching: Stateless services are easier to cache because responses can be cached without any concerns about client context. This can improve performance and reduce server load.
Interoperability: Stateless services are more interoperable because they do not rely on any client-specific state. 
This means that clients can be developed in any programming language or platform as long as they can communicate using the standard HTTP protocol.

6. What resource naming best practices are?

Resource naming is an important aspect of designing RESTful web services. Here are some best practices for resource naming:
Use nouns: Resource names should be nouns that represent the entity being accessed, such as "users", "orders", or "products".
Use plural nouns: Resource names should be plural nouns to represent collections of resources, such as "users" instead of "user".
Use lowercase letters: Resource names should be in lowercase letters to ensure consistency and avoid confusion.
Use hyphens to separate words: If a resource name contains multiple words, use hyphens to separate them, such as "order-items" instead of "orderitems".
Use specific names: Resource names should be specific and descriptive to avoid ambiguity and confusion. For example, use
"customer-orders" instead of "orders" to make it clear that the orders belong to a specific customer.
Use versioning: If you need to change the resource structure or behavior, use versioning to avoid breaking existing clients. For example, use "/v1/users"
instead of "/users" to indicate that this is the first version of the resource.
Use consistent naming conventions: Use consistent naming conventions across all resources to make it easier for developers to understand and use the API.

7. What is Richardson Maturity Model?

The model consists of four levels, each representing a different level of maturity in the implementation of RESTful services:

Level 0 - The Swamp of POX: This level represents the use of HTTP as a transport mechanism for remote procedure calls (RPC).
At this level, the web service is not RESTful and does not use any of the REST constraints.

Level 1 - Resources: This level represents the use of resources to identify entities that can be accessed through the web service. 
At this level, the web service uses URIs to identify resources, but does not use any of the other REST constraints.

Level 2 - HTTP Verbs: This level represents the use of HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources.
At this level, the web service uses HTTP verbs to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

Level 3 - Hypermedia Controls: This level represents the use of hypermedia controls to navigate between resources. 
At this level, the web service uses hypermedia links to provide clients with information about available resources and how to interact with them.
